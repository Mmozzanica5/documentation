This page collects the experience from the group members on doing DQCS shifts.

User Experience
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - **Maurizio**: the shifter pages in the DIRAC portal were not shown out of the box for. Had to wait 2-3 days. Still cannot access the plots through the link below, had to open `Application->Administration->Public State Manager`.
