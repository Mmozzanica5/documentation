DQCS
####
This page collects the experience from the group members on doing DQCS shifts.

User Experience
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 * **28/11--4/12/2022 Maurizio**:

  - You should clone the meeting pages in indico
 
 * **Suggestions**:

  - Prepare for your shift at least a week in advance!
  - Mattermost channel needs invitation by one of the participants (you can ask one of us that already took a shift).

 * **21--28/5/2021 Maurizio**:

  - The shifter pages in the DIRAC portal were not shown out of the box for. Had to wait 2-3 days. Issue was later solved, due to an overloaded machine.
  - Still cannot access the plots through the link below, had to open `Application->Administration->Public State Manager`.
  - When chairing the Computing meeting you don't need to take minutes.
  - Usually there is no need to submit tickets. When noticing something unusual report it to the mattermost channel.
